i2pd
====

i2pd is a full-featured C++ implementation of 
[I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/about/intro) client.

I2P (Invisible Internet Project) is anonymous network which works on top of 
public Internet. Privacy and anonymity are achieved by strong encryption and 
bouncing your traffic through thousands of I2P nodes all around the world.

We are building network which helps people to communicate and share information 
without restrictions.
